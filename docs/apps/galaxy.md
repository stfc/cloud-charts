# Galaxy Setup

Galaxy is a web-based platform for data analytics. 
See [Galaxy Docs](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/) 

To deploy galaxy we use the [Galaxy Chart Repo](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-helm)

## Prerequisites

### Storage
We've tested Galaxy using `longhorn` as default storage - for quick install, ensure longhorn is deployed and available to use

Other storage classes "should" work - as long as they support multiple containers accesssing the same volume (RWX)

### Ingress
For Galaxy to be accessible outside the cluster - we recommend using nginx ingress. Make sure its enabled on your cluster.

## Configuration

Galaxy is default set to deploy tools and config taken for "materials galaxy".

### Adding new tools

We use [Init Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/) to install galaxy tools from git.

To add a new set of galaxy tools - you can add a new init container definition under `extraInitContainers` like so:

We recommend creating a container image to install all your tools instead of using git image like below

```yaml
galaxy:
  ...
  extraInitContainers:
    ...
    - name: clone-my-tools # or name of your tools
      applyToJob: false
      applyToWeb: true # this should just apply to one pod - galaxy-web
      applyToWorkflow: false
      image: "alpine/git:latest" # or your setup image

      # this is an example of how to clone your tools using git
      command: ['sh', '-c', 'git clone https://github.com/me/my-tools.git --depth 1 --branch main {{.Values.persistence.mountPath}}/my-tools || true']
      volumeMounts:
        - name: galaxy-data
          mountPath: "{{.Values.persistence.mountPath}}"
```
`{{.Values.persistence.mountPath}}` is a reference to the filepath for the mounted shared volume - same on all containers

Then edit `galaxy.configs.tool_conf.xml` to make it available to users - add a xml entry like so:

 ```xml
 <tool file="{{.Values.persistence.mountPath}}/my-tools/my-tool-1/my-tool-1.xml>
``` 
where `file` is a filepath to the galaxy tool config you want to make available

### Configuring main page

Edit `galaxy.configs.tool_conf.xml` and `galaxy.configs.integrated_tool_panel.xml` to change the tool panel and add new sections and tools.

Edit `extraFileMappings./galaxy/server/static/welcome.html.content` to change the html for the welcome page

TODO: we need to make separate files for the xml and html files - having them in yaml is confusing


### Configuring runners

Galaxy is configured to use K8s out-of-the-box to run jobs. They will run on the worker nodes. 

> [!WARNING]
> We haven't tested out GPU-bound jobs yet


You can configure galaxy to use other runners - such as slurm. 
See - [Connecting Galaxy to a Compute Cluster](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/connect-to-compute-cluster/tutorial.html)

> [!WARNING]
> We are looking at how to run Slurm into K8s and integrate into Galaxy


### Configuring IAM Setup

We're using oauth2 proxy to handle authentication to IRIS IAM. 
This is because: 

1. Although galaxy offers OIDC support - it only allows access for select providers - see https://galaxyproject.org/authnz/config/oidc/. Adding IRIS IAM authentication would require upstream changes or a fork. 

2. Galaxy does not support authentication client-side (as far as we're aware) - as long as you've got an IAM account and login successfully you can access Galaxy. Oauth proxy enables this and allows us to set up authentication - for example - we can configure it so that only IRIS IAM members that belong to a certain group have access to Galaxy

3. Its seamless! Users will be redirected to IRIS IAM login page before accessing Galaxy.

Other oauth2 proxy config settings can be found here - https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/configuration/overview/. Flags can be passed as `extraArgs`

NOTE: see creating Sops secret about configuring oidc authorization to Galaxy 


### Configuring DNS + certs

To configure what DNS name to use for galaxy - you will need to edit it in 3 places
> [!WARNING] 
> We need to make this easier to change - issue [136](https://github.com/stfc/cloud-deployed-apps/issues/136)

We utilise cert-manager by default for managing certs - and you can see [cert-manager config](./misc.md) on how to configure it to use self-signed or letsencrypt verified certs

```yaml

oauth2-proxy:
  extraArgs:
    # make sure to add this callback to your IAM service config
    redirect-url: "https://my-galaxy.example.com/oauth2/callback" # change dns for redirect

galaxy:
  ingress:
    hosts:
    - host: "my-galaxy.example.com" # change here 
      paths:
        - path: "/"
    tls:
    - hosts:
        - "my-galaxy.example.com" # to enable https - recommended!
      secretName: galaxy-tls
```


## Pre-deployment steps

### 1a. Create Sops Secret (If using ArgoCD)

Galaxy requires `iris-iam` client id and secret to be setup. 

Additionally, if you want to restrict access to galaxy using emails - these should be setup using a sops secret

You can set these secrets using `sops` - template yaml files for setting these secrets can be found in `secret-templates`. See [secrets](../secrets.md) on how to set and encrypt these secrets using sops

### 1b. Set Secrets in sops (If not using ArgoCD)

You'll need to configure IRIS-IAM credentials manually using the template yaml files. Copy these files to tmp directory to avoid committing secrets

```bash
cp charts/$env/$chartName/secret-templates/* /tmp/secret-templates
```

## Deployment 

You can deploy the chart as standalone

```bash
cd cloud-deployed-apps/charts/dev/materials-galaxy
helm dependency upgrade .
helm install my-materials-galaxy . -n materials-galaxy  --create-namespace -f /tmp/secret-templates/materials-galaxy.yaml
```

or you can use argocd to install it - see [Deploying Apps](../deploying-apps.md)


## Common Problems 

### 1. Galaxy pods stuck initializing and db init job crashlooping

**Solution**:  If you're using our longhorn chart, you will need to change `longhorn.persistence.migrateable` to `false` since RWX volumes are incompatible with this. Delete the pvc/pv and restart the job and it should work
